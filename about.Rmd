This is a web version of the poster I made for McGill Global Health Night 2019. 

The poster was entirely build in R using posterdown (see https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki) to build the poster.

You can find the code for the analysis and the poster <a href="https://github.com/trottieralex/posterGHnight_v4/blob/gh-pages/index.Rmd"> here! </a> <br> It mostly use strucchange package and DHScalendR a R package I am developing that is already available.

DHScalendR package: https://github.com/trottieralex/DHScalendR
